UI

Clear purpose - what user achieves / information provided to user 
Clarity - text clear, readable, enough white space 
Information hierarchy - the title, sub title, body, content differentiated by font size 
Proximity and grouping - related items grouped together and create whitespaces to differentiate the different ones clearly 
Toolbar - not same as tabbar, has additional tools like create, share etc 
Tabbar - if u select a particular item others get unselected 
Menu - additional tools on top displayed using pop up
